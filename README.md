# Simple Energy Calculator

The code defines a Python class called Object, which calculates the energy required to move an object based on its weight and distance, using the formula J = (weight * gravity * distance) / 454, where gravity is a constant.

# About

This code creates a Python class called Object, which represents an object with weight and distance attributes. It calculates the energy required to move the object based on these values, using the formula J = (weight * gravity * distance) / 454, where gravity is a constant. The user inputs the object's weight in pounds and the distance between two points in meters, creates an instance of the Object class, calculates the energy, and prints the result.

# Features

The Python code demonstrates the principles of object-oriented programming and energy calculations by creating an `Object` class with two attributes: `weight` representing the object's weight in pounds and `distance` representing the distance between two points in meters. The purpose of the `Object` class is to calculate the energy required to move the object using the formula \(J = \frac{{\text{{weight}} \times \text{{gravity}} \times \text{{distance}}}}{{454}}\).

The user inputs the object's weight and distance, and an instance of the `Object` class is created based on this input. The script calculates the energy using the provided formula and prints the result to the console. To enhance the functionality of the `Object` class, consider adding error handling, unit conversions, and additional methods. This code demonstrates the principles of object-oriented programming and energy calculations.

# Rating

For several reasons, including spelling and grammar errors, lack of comments, input validation, class design, and variable naming. The code is criticized for its lack of clarity and professionalism, as well as its inability to handle non-numeric or negative values, which could cause the program to crash. The `Object` class is designed to calculate the energy required to move an object based on its weight and distance, but it lacks encapsulation, as the `gravity` variable is defined within the `__init__` method but is not stored as an attribute. The variable names are not very descriptive, and it would be more clear to rename `J` to something more meaningful, such as `required_energy`, and rename `wight` and `distance` to `weight` and `distance` for clarity. Overall, the code has several areas for improvement to enhance readability, maintainability, and robustness.
